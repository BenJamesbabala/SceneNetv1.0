#SceneNet

All the necessary source code for SceneNet  [SceneNet: Understanding Real World Indoor Scenes with Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07041) will be available here soon.

#Updates

This code enables depth and annotation rendering given a 3D model and trajectory. We provide a sample 3D model in the **data** folder and a trajectory in **data/room_89_simple_data** folder. More details will be updated soon. Things to do 

- [ ] Simulated Annealing
- [ ] RGB Rendering
- [ ] Releasing Trajectories
- [ ] Converting Depth to DHA format
- [ ] Emphasise on Negative Focal Length
